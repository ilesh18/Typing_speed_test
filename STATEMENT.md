<h1>5.2 Statement.md</h1> <h2>Problem Statement</h2> <p>In today's digital age, efficient typing skills are essential for productivity, communication, and professional success. However, many individuals lack a convenient, engaging way to practice and track their typing speed and accuracy. Existing typing test tools may be web-based, require internet access, or lack personalized progress tracking and gamification elements. There is a need for a simple, offline command-line application that allows users to perform typing tests, measure performance metrics like Words Per Minute (WPM), identify errors, and monitor long-term improvement through achievements and visual progress charts. This project addresses the gap by providing an accessible tool for self-improvement in typing proficiency.</p> <h2>Scope of the Project</h2> <p>The project focuses on developing a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) application for typing speed testing. It includes database integration for persistent storage of user results and achievements, but excludes advanced features like real-time multiplayer modes, web interfaces, or integration with external APIs. The scope covers:</p> <ul> <li>Core functionality: Typing tests, challenges, result viewing, and achievement unlocking.</li> <li>Data management: MySQL database for storing user data.</li> <li>Visualization: Basic plotting of progress using Matplotlib.</li> <li>Error handling and user input validation.</li> <li>Out-of-scope: GUI development, mobile app versions, advanced AI for error correction, or cloud deployment.</li> </ul> <p>The project aims to be lightweight, easy to set up, and runnable on systems with Python and MySQL installed.</p> <h2>Target Users</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Students and Learners</strong>: Individuals seeking to improve typing skills for academic purposes, such as note-taking or essay writing.</li> <li><strong>Professionals</strong>: Office workers, writers, programmers, and data entry personnel who need to enhance typing speed and accuracy for daily tasks.</li> <li><strong>Casual Users</strong>: Hobbyists or anyone interested in self-improvement, including gamers who want to track typing-related achievements.</li> <li><strong>Educators</strong>: Teachers who can use the tool to assess and encourage typing practice among students.</li> </ul> <p>The app is suitable for users with basic computer literacy, as it runs via command-line and requires minimal setup.</p> <h2>High-Level Features</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Typing Test Mode</strong>: Users complete a series of 5 random sentences, with real-time calculation of WPM, time taken, and error count. Results are saved and averaged for overall performance.</li> <li><strong>Typing Challenge Mode</strong>: Timed challenges with selectable difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard), enforcing time limits and providing instant feedback.</li> <li><strong>Progress Tracking</strong>: View historical test results and visualize the last 5 attempts via Matplotlib graphs.</li> <li><strong>Achievements System</strong>: Unlock badges based on milestones, such as reaching specific WPM thresholds, achieving perfect accuracy, or completing multiple tests.</li> <li><strong>Database Persistence</strong>: Secure storage of user data in MySQL, including results and achievements, with query-based retrieval.</li> <li><strong>Error Analysis</strong>: Basic detection of incorrect words using sequence matching, with reporting of mistakes.</li> <li><strong>User Management</strong>: Simple username-based sessions for tracking individual progress.</li> <li><strong>Instructions and Menu</strong>: Built-in help and a navigable CLI menu for easy interaction.</li> </ul>
